QUESTION: The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

APPROACH:
 ->iterate on each row in a N*N matrix and CHECK whether you can place in a particular cell in a row
   ->HOW TO CHECK?
     *check whether a queen is present in upper-column,upper-left-diagonal,upper-right-diagonal
     *if YES -> return FALSE to the previous call
     *if NO -> return TRUE and try to place another queen in next row
     *repeat till row pointer reaches N (base case)
 ->NOTE: don't need to check lower-column,lower-left-diagonal,lower-right-diagonal because we are traversing each row from top,
         so there won't be any queen on up coming rows
*/

VARIATION: if you are asked to print all the possible configurations of N-queens, put 'return false' in the base case instead of 'return true'
           this will help to find all other possible configurations even after finding a particular configuration.
